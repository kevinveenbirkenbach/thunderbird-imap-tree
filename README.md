# thunderbird-imap-tree
 This script processes Thunderbird's folderTree.json files, extracting email folder structures from the JSON data. Written in Python, it interprets the IMAP paths to generate and display a hierarchical tree representation of your email folders, akin to the directory structure in a bash shell.
